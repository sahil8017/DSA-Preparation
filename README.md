# 📘 DSA Preparation – For Mid-size MNCs

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) preparation repository!  
This project is focused on building a solid understanding of DSA concepts through curated problem-solving, mainly for mid-size product and service-based companies.

Inspired by resources and notes from **The Boring Education**, this repo is my personal roadmap to mastering DSA.
